# mtalk-ips
A list of IPs for mtalk.google.com(aka Google FCM service) that connectable from Mainland China.

The second column is the milliseconds to establish a tcp connection to 5228 port of the IP.

## Help wanted
Really appriciate if you could do DNS lookup `mtalk.google.com` in your network and share it if you find a connectable IP.
